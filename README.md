# Rainfall-prediction-mini-project

# Project Description
The goal of this project is to use historical weather data to predict rainfall patterns effectively. The dataset includes various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud coverage. This analysis can help in climate monitoring and disaster management.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and cleaning data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis to explore relationships between features.
Seasonal Patterns: Certain months consistently show higher rainfall, likely linked to monsoon cycles or regional climatic conditions.
Modeling: Building and evaluating baseline models for rainfall prediction.
Insights: Deriving actionable insights from the data to improve prediction accuracy.

# Dataset
The dataset contains monthly averages of:
Maximum and minimum temperature
Rainfall
Relative humidity
Wind speed
Cloud coverage
Bright sunshine hours
Additionally, it includes geographical data:
Weather station number
Coordinates (X, Y)
Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude

# Insights
Actionable Recommendations:
For agricultural stakeholders to Prepare for potential droughts or floods based on early seasonal predictions.
For disaster management to allocate resources in high-risk periods to mitigate the impact of extreme rainfall events.
